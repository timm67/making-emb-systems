### Questions

* What are the hardware registers that cause the LED to turn on and off? (From the processor manual, donâ€™t worry about initialization.) 

In my case, the LED is attached to PC13, So the GPIO port output data register for port C would be used, GPIOC_ODR. This register is at 0x4002 0800 plus offset 0x14, or 0x4002 0814.

`*((volatile uint32_t *)0x40020814) |= (1 << 13);`

Would extinguish the LED, since the gpio is sinking the current from the rail.

`*((volatile uint32_t *)0x40020814) &= ~(1 << 13);`

would be the expression to light the led

* What are the button registers that you read?

The button in my case is the classic momentarily closed connection from PA0 to ground. Thus, if this were a polling implementation, I would read the GPIO port input data register at 0x4002 0000 plus offset 0x10, or 0x40020010, and bit 1 would indicate the button were pressed if 0, or unpressed if 1. The gpio must be configured to have an internal pullup via the GPIO port pull-up/pull-down register (offset 0x0C). 

```
typedef enum {false=0, true} bool;
bool button_pressed;

if *((volatile uint32_t *)0x40020010) & (1 << 0)
   button_pressed = false;
else
   button_pressed = true;

```

In my case, I used an interrupt (rising edge) on the gpio connected to the button to set an event flag in FreeRTOS. This is accomplished by overriding the weak reference for `void HAL_GPIO_EXTI_Callback(uint16_t GPIO_Pin)`. The method checks for `GPIO_PIN0` as an argument passed in, and if that is the case, sets a FreeRTOS event flag via `osEventFlagsSet()`. Another thread looks at this value, changes the LED state if it is set and clears the event flag via osEventFlagsClear(). There is a delay of at least one scheduler tick involved in this process, and can be increased to prevent bouncing as showing up as multiple events. 

* Can you read that memory directly and see the button change in a debugger or by printing out the associated memory?

Having the ISR copy the register value into a variable, which you could put a debugger watch on would probably be the best way.
