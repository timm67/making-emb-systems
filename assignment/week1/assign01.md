# Invent an 'Imaginary' Embedded System

Vital signs monitors are actually a common embedded system in varying degrees of complexity. Hospital grade units use EKG leads to visualize the patient's cardiac activity and derive heart rate, pulse rate. More recently, the invention of a relatively simple optical sensor with two wavelengths has allowed pulse oximetry to be easily and inexpensively measured by microcontroller based systems. These systems can measure SpO2 and derive pulse rate. More sophisticated algorithms can compute heart rate variability, which can be used for biofeedback in athletic performance and stress management through breath control. 

One of many complications associated with managing CoVID-19 is fast screening methods for allowing people entrance to facilities, for example. Often time this consists of a non-contact temperature measurement. This is accomplished via an Infrared thermometer. Much as SpO2 measurement can now be done with an integrated, relatively low cost sensor, non-contact temperature measurement sensors exist also. 

An embedded system could be built using these two relatively low cost, high integration sensors to measure SpO2 and non-contact temperature at the same time. This would provide a slightly more precise means of assessing whether a person had CoVID-19 or not. This device could also be used to assess more conventional illnesses such as the flu. Lastly, as an advanced feature, machine learning techniques could be used to fuse and process the measurements and give a high level assessment to the user.
